/**
 * Put the description and the share card on a Garmin gym activity.
 *
 * The sibling of `enrichGarminRunActivities`, for the other half of what soma sends to Garmin.
 * Runs have had both since the TypeScript cutover; gym workouts lost them on 2026-07-16 when the
 * Python pipeline was deleted, and have reached Garmin (and Strava, which reads the Garmin
 * activity's own description) with neither ever since. Restores
 * `pipeline._enrich_garmin_activity` (soma#982).
 *
 * The two endpoints are the ones the Python used and the run enricher already uses, so nothing
 * new is being learned here: `PUT /activity-service/activity/{id}` carries the description and
 * `POST /activity-service/activity/{id}/image` carries the PNG. garmin-auth's `send()` refreshes
 * the DI token on 401, which is why this does not need the hevy2garmin package's own
 * `setDescription`.
 *
 * EXTERNAL Garmin writes. Idempotent through the `garmin_enrichment` ledger.
